            A launch vehicle or carrier rocket is a rocket-propelled vehicle
            used to carry a payload from Earth's surface to space, usually to
            Earth orbit or beyond. Our WEB-X carrier rocket is the most powerful
            in operation. Standing 150 metres tall, it's quite an awe-inspiring
            sight on the launch pad!
