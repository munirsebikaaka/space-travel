            A space capsule is an often-crewed spacecraft that uses a blunt-body
            reentry capsule to reenter the Earth's atmosphere without wings. Our
            capsule is where you'll spend your time during the flight. It
            includes a space gym, cinema, and plenty of other activities to keep
            you entertained.
